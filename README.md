# Max Reps
Max Reps is a full CRUD workout log application. The application allows a user to log an exercise for one of five muscle groups. The user can see their exercises by clicking on the desired muscle group, which then brings them to the exercise index page. The user then has the choice to create a new exercise, or see a specific exercise by clicking on it. If the user decides to create a new exercise they are then brought to a new exercise form, which logs the goals for that exercise. If the user chose to view their exercise, it then brings them to the show page of that exercise. On this page the user sees all their exercise information. They can also choose to post the results to this exercise, or edit the exercise. Posting the results brings the user to a results form, where they log their post exercise data. If they chose to edit the exercise, it brings the user to an edit page where they can edit their whole exercise.
